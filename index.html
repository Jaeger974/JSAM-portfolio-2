      <p>I am a <strong>biochemistry graduate with industry experience </strong> in GLP compliant sites since the completion of my degree. I have a keen eye for detail and have extensive experience in supervision and managing large cohorts in the pharma/agrochemical industries. I have assimilated what my parents have always taught me: ‘If it is worth doing, it is worth doing right’. I uphold myself to a high standard which, paralleled with my approachable demeanour, allows me to confidently and effectively maintain high GLP standards for myself and my team.
Understanding the complexities of Quality assurance and having experience within this industry, where potential errors can have dire consequences, I deem honest communication to be crucial in mitigating and resolving non-compliance.
